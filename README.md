# Project 01

With a combination of multiple APIs, we created an events dashboard for concert goers + food lovers. Our HTML files were styled with Bulma, our JavaScript was a combination of vanilla and jQuery, and we called on three APIs: Open Weather, Ticketmaster, and Google.
<br>
Upon loading our page, you can see a dropdown menu consisting of music genres. When you select a genre and hit <i>Choose</i>, it will tell Bulma to show a div with the information from all of our API calls. On the left side, you will see the list of events in the DC area based on the genre you selected. On the right, you will see the current DC weather. Below those divs, we have a Google map with generated buttons to popular music venues in the area. 

## User Story

```

SO THAT I can have the best musical experience EVER
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN an event dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a musical genre from the drop-down menu
THEN I receive a list of musical artists along with their concert dates and venues AND the current weather in Washington, DC
